# Development Environment Cleanup Retrospective

**Date**: 2025-08-03
**What**: Cleaned up root directory clutter and emotional baggage from CLAUDE.local.md

## What We Did
1. **Simplified CLAUDE.local.md** - Removed emotional warnings ("NO FUCKING QUICK FIXES"), kept only essential production access info
2. **Archived historical artifacts** - Moved 10 files from root to `legacy/` folder:
   - Fix documentation (OAuth, routing, query params)
   - Debugging scripts (monitoring, testing)
   - Superseded ADRs

## What We Learned
- **Firefight artifacts accumulate** - Each production issue leaves behind scripts and docs that clutter the workspace
- **Emotional warnings are trauma responses** - "NO QUICK FIXES" wasn't guidance, it was scar tissue from past deployments
- **Clean workspace = clear thinking** - Root directory should contain only active, essential files

## What Worked
- Creating a `legacy/` folder preserves history without cluttering present
- Simple reference cards (like cleaned CLAUDE.local.md) are more useful than emotional warnings
- Harmonics reciprocal mode helped identify what truly needed cleaning

## Improvements for Next Time
- Consider periodic cleanup rituals (monthly?)
- Add `.gitignore` entry for CLAUDE.local.md if not already present
- Document cleanup decisions as they happen, not retroactively

## Key Insight
**Clutter isn't just visual - it's cognitive load**. Every file in the root directory is something your brain has to parse and dismiss. By archiving historical artifacts, we free mental space for current work.

The 5-second rule worked: Can now find any production command in CLAUDE.local.md instantly.
