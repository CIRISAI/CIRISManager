For CIRISManager Claude:

  Looking at our production setup, I recommend Option 1 - move nginx config to /opt/ciris-manager/nginx/. Here's why:

  Current Production Reality:
  - Nginx container already running at /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/agents.ciris.ai
  - It works well for static configs
  - Docker volume can mount from anywhere

  Recommended Architecture:
  /opt/ciris-manager/
  ├── nginx/
  │   └── agents.conf      # Manager writes here (has permissions)
  └── agents/              # Agent data

  nginx container:
    volumes:
      - /opt/ciris-manager/nginx/agents.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/agents.conf:ro

  Why not the alternatives:
  - Traefik: Adds complexity, requires learning curve, overkill for our needs
  - Self-healing permissions: Band-aid solution, permissions shouldn't need "healing"

  Implementation path:
  1. Manager writes to /opt/ciris-manager/nginx/agents.conf
  2. Update docker-compose to mount this into nginx container
  3. Nginx reload command stays the same

  This keeps our current nginx setup (which works) while solving the permission issue cleanly. The manager owns its config directory, nginx just reads it.
