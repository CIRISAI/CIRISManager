GEMINI:
Of course. Here is a review of your microservice routing architecture, along with a recommended solution.

The simplest and most maintainable architecture for your needs is the **Configuration Reload** pattern you're already using. Your current design—where the Manager Service writes configuration files that an Nginx container reads—is a robust and common solution for single-server deployments. The problem isn't the architecture; it's the implementation of the file permissions.

Instead of re-architecting, let's fix the existing model.

### **The Root Cause of the Problem**

Your systemd service files are designed to solve this exact permission issue using the `ReadWritePaths` directive. This directive explicitly grants your `ciris-manager` service write access to the `/home/ciris/nginx` directory.

The "permission denied" error you're seeing likely means one of two things:

1.  The systemd service file you are actually running is different from the ones in the repository and is missing the `ReadWritePaths` line.
2.  The underlying filesystem permissions on the `/home/ciris/` directory or its subdirectories are too restrictive, preventing the `ciris-manager` user from accessing the `nginx` folder.

-----

### **Solution: Fix the Permission Model**

Follow these steps to resolve the issue permanently.

#### **Step 1: Set Correct Filesystem Permissions**

First, ensure the `ciris-manager` user (which runs your service) and the `ciris` group (which should be associated with the Docker containers) both have access to the Nginx configuration directory.

Execute these commands on your server:

```bash
# Ensure the shared group 'ciris' exists
sudo groupadd ciris || true

# Assign ownership of the nginx directory to the manager user and the shared group
sudo chown -R ciris-manager:ciris /home/ciris/nginx

# Set permissions to allow the owner (ciris-manager) and group to read/write/execute
sudo chmod -R 775 /home/ciris/nginx
```

These commands give the Manager Service the necessary permissions to write config files, while still allowing other container processes in the `ciris` group to access them if needed.

#### **Step 2: Verify the Systemd Service File**

Next, confirm that your active systemd service file includes the directive that grants write access.

1.  Open your service file for editing:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl edit ciris-manager-api.service
    ```
2.  Ensure the `[Service]` section contains the following line, which explicitly grants access:
    ```ini
    ReadWritePaths=/home/ciris/nginx
    ```
    *(Note: The full line in your source file is longer, but this is the critical part for solving your issue.)*

#### **Step 3: Reload and Restart**

Finally, apply the changes and restart the service for them to take effect.

```bash
# Reload the systemd daemon to read the updated service file
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Restart the CIRISManager API service
sudo systemctl restart ciris-manager-api
```

After restarting, your Manager Service should now be able to write to the Nginx directory without any permission errors.

### **Architectural Refinement (Optional)**

While the above steps will fix your immediate problem, you can make your architecture even more robust with a small change.

Currently, your `NginxManager` generates the *entire* `nginx.conf` file from a template. A safer pattern is to manage only the dynamic parts.

  * **Current:** `NginxManager` writes one large `nginx.conf` file.
  * **Better:** Let `NginxManager` write and delete smaller, agent-specific `*.conf` files (e.g., `agent-scout.conf`, `agent-sage.conf`) inside a dedicated directory like `/home/ciris/nginx/agents-conf/`.

Your main Nginx configuration would then use an `include` directive to load these dynamic files, just as the template file `nginx-ciris-manager.conf` already suggests. This isolates changes and reduces the risk of a single bad template generation taking down your entire reverse proxy.
