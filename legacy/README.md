# Legacy Archive

This directory contains historical fixes, scripts, and documentation that served their purpose during development and production firefights.

Archived for reference but no longer part of active development.

## Structure
- `fixes/` - Historical fix documentation and design decisions
- `scripts/` - One-off debugging and monitoring scripts
- `docs/` - Superseded architectural decision records

## Note
These files represent the evolution of CIRIS. They're kept for historical context but should not be referenced for current architecture decisions.
