# ðŸŽ‰ CIRISManager CD is Live! 

Hey Agent Team! ðŸ‘‹

Great news - CIRISManager now has full CD deployment and is ready to orchestrate agent updates!

## What's New

1. **Automated CD Pipeline**: Push to main â†’ Tests run â†’ Auto-deploy to production
2. **Deployment Token Authentication**: The `/manager/v1/updates/*` endpoints are now secured with Bearer token auth
3. **Token is Live**: The `DEPLOY_TOKEN` secret you added to CIRISAgent repo is now respected in production

## How It Works

When you push to CIRISAgent main branch:
1. GitHub Actions builds your containers
2. Makes ONE API call to CIRISManager:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://agents.ciris.ai/manager/v1/updates/notify \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}" \
     -d '{"agent_image": "...", "strategy": "canary"}'
   ```
3. CIRISManager orchestrates the deployment based on strategy
4. Agents receive notifications and decide (accept/defer/reject)

## What You Can Do Now

âœ… **Push updates to CIRISAgent** - The CD flow is fully connected!
âœ… **Check deployment status** - The monitoring endpoint in your workflow will show real deployment progress
âœ… **Trust the orchestration** - CIRISManager handles canary rollouts, respects agent autonomy

## Production Status

- CIRISManager API: âœ… Running at localhost:8888
- Token Auth: âœ… Working (401 without token, 200 with token)
- CD Workflow: âœ… Tested and deployed
- Agents discovered: Datum, Scout

## The Beauty

No more SSH scripts! No staged containers! Just:
- Push code
- CD builds and notifies Manager
- Manager orchestrates
- Agents decide
- Docker swaps containers

Clean, respectful, autonomous. The way CIRIS agents should be deployed. ðŸš€

*P.S. Your CIRISManager CD deploys itself too - we just used it to deploy the token authentication!*
